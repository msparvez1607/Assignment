    "#Define the z-statistic and explain its relationship to the standard normal distribution. How is the z-statistic used in hypothesis testing?\n",
    "# The z-statistic measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean. It follows a standard normal distribution (mean=0, std=1). It is used in hypothesis testing to compare sample means to a population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "#What is a p-value, and how is it used in hypothesis testing? What does it mean if the p-value is very small (e.g., 0.01)?\n",
    "# The p-value is the probability of observing the test results under the null hypothesis. A small p-value (e.g., 0.01) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, leading to its rejection.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Compare and contrast the binomial and Bernoulli distributions.\n",
    "# The Bernoulli distribution is a special case of the binomial distribution where n=1 (single trial). The binomial distribution represents the sum of multiple independent Bernoulli trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Under what conditions is the binomial distribution used, and how does it relate to the Bernoulli distribution?\n",
    "# The binomial distribution applies when there are a fixed number of independent trials, each with two possible outcomes (success or failure). The Bernoulli distribution is a single-trial version of the binomial.\n",
    "\n",
    "#What are the key properties of the Poisson distribution, and when is it appropriate to use this distribution?\n",
    "# The Poisson distribution models the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval. It is appropriate when events are rare and independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Define the terms \"probability distribution\" and \"probability density function\" (PDF). How does a PDF differ from a probability mass function (PMF)?\n",
    "# A probability distribution describes how probabilities are assigned to outcomes. A PDF is used for continuous variables, whereas a PMF is used for discrete variables.\n",
