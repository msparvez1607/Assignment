    "        \"1\": \"NumPy is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for large multidimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently. It enhances Python's capabilities by offering fast operations and memory-efficient computations, making it ideal for scientific computing and data analysis.\",\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \"2\": \"np.mean() calculates the arithmetic mean, while np.average() allows weighted averages. Use np.average() when different elements have varying importance.\",\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \"3\": \"To reverse an array: np.flip(arr) reverses along all axes, arr[::-1] reverses a 1D array, and np.flip(arr, axis=0/1) reverses a 2D array along rows/columns.\",\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \"4\": \"Use arr.dtype to determine data type. Data types impact memory usage and computation speed, making them crucial for performance optimization.\",\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \"5\": \"ndarrays are NumPyâ€™s core array structure, supporting multidimensional data storage with better performance than Python lists due to contiguous memory storage.\",\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \"6\": \"NumPy arrays are faster than Python lists because they use contiguous memory blocks, which optimize CPU cache usage and reduce overhead from Python objects.\",\n",

    "        \"7\": \"vstack() vertically stacks arrays (along rows), while hstack() stacks arrays horizontally (along columns).\",\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \"8\": \"fliplr() flips arrays left to right (column-wise), while flipud() flips them upside down (row-wise).\",\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \"9\": \"array_split() splits arrays into equal or nearly equal parts. If uneven, some parts may have one more element than others.\",\n",

    "        \"10\": \"Vectorization enables element-wise operations without explicit loops, and broadcasting allows operations on differently shaped arrays by extending smaller ones automatically.\"\n",
